As a student in security engineering, and with cybersecurity also being my passion, I created this website to archive/publish write-ups of my CTF participation and some of my personal projects.

As for me, I am currently working as a pentester in an alternating work-study program. If you want more information, please contact me directly, and feel free to check out my available networks on the homepage.
